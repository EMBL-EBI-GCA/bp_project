Variation calls  produced by Bisulfite-Seq of sample W653 were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38) using GEM (3.0).
Mapping
-------

The mapping was carried out using GEM 3.0 in bisulfite mapping mode 
to a converted reference sequence:

     GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna 

which can be found here:

URL: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/Eukaryotes/vertebrates_mammals/Homo_sapiens/GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz

The reference file contains two copies of the hsapiens GRCh38 reference, 
one with all C's changes to T's and one with all G's changed to A's. 
In addition the file also contains two copies of the NCBI viral genome 
dataset (rel 69, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/GenomesHome.cgi?
taxid=10239), modified in the same way as for the human genome.
For the viral contigs the names have been shortened to the accession# only. 
Before mapping, the original sequence in the input FASTQ was stored 
(by appending to the sequence ID line).  The sequence data was then 
modified so that any C's in the first read of a pair were converted to
T's, and any G's on the second read of a pair were converted to A's.
The mapping was then performed, and the original sequence was replaced
in the output mapping.  


Command line used:

gem3-mapper -p --bisulfite-mode -I GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set_BS.gem -s 1 -p -M 4


The SAM output produced by the gem3 mapper contains a custom tag, XB,
that denotes the version of the reference to which the read is mapped
(either CT or GA).  Read pairs were selected using the default
read-pairing algorithm in gem3, and where the assigned MAPQ score for
the read pair was &gt;=20.


Filtering
----------------------------

Filtering of CpG sites and homozygous cytosines was
performed on the VCF output of bs_call using the program filter_vcf
with default parameters.

Command line used:

vcf_filter sample.vcf

This generate one file per sample with all observed sites where the reference
or the called genotype indicates the possible presence of a C followed
by a G.  No other filtering is performed.

col 1 : Chromosome
col 2 : Position of first base in dinucleotide (C) (offset 1)
col 3 : Reference bases at the two positions
col 4 : Called genotypes at the two positions (iupac codes used for heterozygous calls)
col 5 : Phred scaled probability of genotype *not* being as in col 4
col 6 : Methylation probability (combined estimate from the weighted average of the MLEs at the two positions)
col 7 : Standard deviation of methylation probability (from weighted average)
col 8 : No. of non-converted C reads (sum of counts at both positions)
col 9 : No. of converted C reads (idem)
col 10: Total reads supporting genotype call (idem)
col 11: Total reads (idem)
col 12: 8 comma separated numbers with allele counts: (A,C,G,T) not
        informative for methylation and (A,C,G,T) informative for methylation
        from forward strand
col 13: idem from reverse strand
